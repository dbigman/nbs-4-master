## Machine Learning in Action

Welcome! Today we'll kick off by exploring some exciting Machine Learning (ML) demos. These interactive experiences will give you a firsthand look at how ML algorithms work in real-world applications.

### Explore the Demos:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - Predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on various features like age, class, and gender.

### What to Do:

- **Interact** with each demo to see how input data is processed and what results are generated.
- **Observe** how changing the input affects the output.
- **Think About** the underlying ML models that might be powering these applications.

### Discussion Points:

- How does the model make predictions in the Titanic Survival demo?
- What are the challenges in accurately detecting sentiment in text?
- In what ways could entity recognition be useful in real-world applications?
- What technologies enable real-time sign language detection?

Feel free to ask questions and share your thoughts as you explore these demos. Let's dive in and see Machine Learning come to life!
